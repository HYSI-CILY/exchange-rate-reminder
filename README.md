# exchange-rate-reminder

This project is to get the exchange rate between yuan and euro using web scraping.

Update: 
I'm trying to use docker to empack the back end of the application. To build the docker image, you can do in the folder of Dockerfile and tape # docker build -t NAME_IMAGE . # and then run the container by # docker run NAME_IMAGE #
